    6. Fuel Tank size: How many gallons of fuel can fit in the car
    7. Tank Restrictions: If race is limiting fuel size, input here (no restrictions, enter 100, if limited to 30%, enter 30)

    2. Number of Laps: number of laps in the race, or expected number to run
    3. Fuel used per lap: how much fuel car consumes on a per lap basis
